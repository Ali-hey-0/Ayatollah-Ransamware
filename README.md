  - Comprehensive logging system

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1. Encryption Process
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Generate RSA Keys] --> B[Scan Directory]
    B --> C[Generate AES Key]
    C --> D[Encrypt File]
    D --> E[Encrypt AES Key]
    E --> F[Save Key File]
```

### 2. Decryption Process
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Read Key File] --> B[Decrypt AES Key]
    B --> C[Read Encrypted File]
    C --> D[Decrypt File]
```

## üì¶ Installation & Usage

### C Implementation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Ayatollah-Ransomware.git

# Compile (Windows)
gcc src/c/ayatollah-ransomware.c -o ransomware -lcrypt32

# Run
./ransomware
```

### Python Implementation
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install cryptography

# Run
python src/python/ayatollah-ransomware.py
```

### JavaScript Implementation
```bash
# Ensure Node.js is installed
node src/javascript/ayatollah-ransomware.js
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The program uses `config.enc` for settings:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Target Directory | `C:\test` | Directory to process |
| Log Level | `INFO` | Logging detail level |
| Thread Count | `4` | Number of processing threads |

## üîç Technical Details
